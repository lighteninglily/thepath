CRITICAL FIX: Backgrounds now persist correctly when reopening editor

PROBLEM:
- User adds background to slide 7
- Saves changes
- Closes editor
- Reopens editor
- Background is GONE!

ROOT CAUSE:
The handleOpenSlideEditor() function was ALWAYS creating new background arrays
based on current UI state (selectedBackground, selectedPack, selectedLook).

This happened EVERY TIME you clicked "Edit Slides", which OVERWROTE the 
backgrounds we just carefully loaded from the database!

Flow was:
1. Load song → Extract backgrounds from database → Set slideBackgrounds ✓
2. Click "Edit Slides" → handleOpenSlideEditor runs
3. Create NEW backgrounds array → OVERWRITES slideBackgrounds ✗
4. Editor opens with wrong backgrounds

SOLUTION:
Check if backgrounds/layouts are already loaded before creating new ones:
- If slideBackgrounds.length === currentSlides.length → Use loaded data
- If not → Create new arrays (for NEW songs only)

This preserves database-loaded backgrounds while still supporting new songs.

CODE CHANGES:
- Added hasLoadedData check in handleOpenSlideEditor
- Early return if backgrounds already loaded
- Only create new arrays for genuinely new songs
- Added comprehensive debug logging

IMPACT:
- Backgrounds now persist correctly ✓
- Layouts now persist correctly ✓  
- User changes are respected and saved ✓
- No more data loss when reopening editor ✓

This was the REAL root cause of the persistence issue!
