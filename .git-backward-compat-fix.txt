FIX: Restore background compatibility for existing songs

Problem: Audience view showed black backgrounds for existing songs
Cause: Code was only checking for imageUrl, but existing songs use imageId

Solution: Check both imageUrl (new format) and imageId (old format)
Now works with:
- Old songs created before fix (imageId)
- New songs created after fix (imageUrl)
- Both formats resolve to background URL correctly

This maintains backward compatibility with all existing content
