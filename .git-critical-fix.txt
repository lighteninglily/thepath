CRITICAL FIX: Connect AI modals to template system

Previously AI modals generated content but stored as JSON with no visual representation.

Now the flow works properly:
1. AI generates content (sermon/offering/welcome/closing)
2. Template picker opens automatically
3. User selects a template
4. Template is populated with AI-generated content
5. Item created with visual template
6. User can edit in Visual Editor (add logos, images, etc.)

Changes:
- Added pendingAIContent state to store AI data
- Modified all AI handlers to open template picker after generation
- Updated handleSelectTemplate to populate templates with AI content
- Maps AI fields to template element IDs
- Added offering to templateCategory type

This fixes the critical issue where AI-generated slides were blank/unusable
