FEATURE: Beautiful drag & drop slide reordering

Added smooth, visual drag & drop to slide navigator using @dnd-kit

VISUAL EFFECTS:
✨ Drag handle appears on hover (left side of thumbnail)
✨ Cursor changes to "grab" when hovering handle
✨ Slide becomes semi-transparent (50% opacity) while dragging
✨ Scales up slightly when picked up (105%)
✨ Massive shadow effect during drag
✨ Beautiful drag overlay follows cursor showing slide preview
✨ "Moving..." badge on dragged slide
✨ Smooth animations during reorder
✨ Blue highlight shows drop target
✨ Auto-scroll when dragging near top/bottom edges

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Installed @dnd-kit/core, @dnd-kit/sortable, @dnd-kit/utilities
- Created SortableSlideItem component with useSortable hook
- 8px movement threshold before drag activates (prevents accidental drags)
- DragOverlay shows floating preview of slide being moved
- Maintains all existing functionality (click, duplicate, delete)
- Works with keyboard (accessible)

USER EXPERIENCE:
1. Hover over slide thumbnail
2. Drag handle appears on left (⋮⋮ icon)
3. Click and hold drag handle
4. Slide becomes semi-transparent
5. Drag preview floats under cursor
6. Drop between any two slides
7. Smooth animation to new position
8. Auto-saves immediately

STILL WORKS:
✅ Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+↑/↓)
✅ Click to select slide
✅ Duplicate/delete buttons
✅ All existing functionality

This makes slide reordering incredibly intuitive and satisfying!
