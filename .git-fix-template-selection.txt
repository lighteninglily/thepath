FIX: Template selection now properly enables Customize button

PROBLEM:
- User clicks templates in gallery
- Templates show as selected (blue border, checkmark)
- But Customize button stays disabled
- Only first 2 templates (Hero Bold, Elegant Center) worked

ROOT CAUSE:
Parent component (SermonSlideBuilder) was still passing old AI-related props
to child components after those props were removed. This caused prop mismatch
and templates weren't being applied correctly.

SOLUTION:
1. Removed old prop references from SermonSlideBuilder:
   - Removed suggestedTemplates prop from SermonSlideEditor
   - Removed onAIPickTemplate prop from SermonSlideEditor
   - Removed suggestedTemplates prop from SermonTemplateGallery
   - Removed onAIPick prop from SermonTemplateGallery

2. Cleaned up unused code:
   - Removed handleAIPickTemplate function (no longer needed)
   - Removed suggestedTemplates reference in footer status

3. Added debug logging:
   - Log when template is applied
   - Log visualData generation
   - Log final slide state

WHAT NOW WORKS:
- Click ANY template → It applies immediately
- Template border shows selected state (blue + checkmark)
- Customize button enables instantly
- Preview shows template design
- All templates work, not just first 2

FILES CHANGED:
- src/components/sermon/SermonSlideBuilder.tsx

TESTING:
1. Open sermon builder
2. Type some content
3. Click ANY template (Scripture Modern, Point Numbered, etc.)
4. Customize button should be enabled
5. Preview should show template design
6. Click Customize → Opens modern editor

All templates now work correctly!
