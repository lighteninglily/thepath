CRITICAL FIX: React hooks violation - move useEffect before early return

Problem: "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render"
Cause: useEffect was declared AFTER early return statement
React Rule: All hooks must be called before any conditional returns

Solution: Moved auto-start presentation useEffect to line 106
Now executes BEFORE the early return at line 136
All hooks now called in consistent order every render

This fixes the crash when opening ServiceEditorModal
