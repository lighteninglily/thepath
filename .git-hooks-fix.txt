Fix React hooks violation in auto-start presentation

Fixed error: Cannot access handleStartPresentation before initialization

Solution: Inlined presentation start logic instead of calling function
Now uses startPresentation from store directly in useEffect
Proper cleanup with timer clearTimeout

User must refresh browser to see changes (Ctrl+Shift+R)
