UX: Make drag & drop more discoverable and easier to use

Enhanced visibility and usability of slide reordering

IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Drag handle now ALWAYS visible (not just on hover)
2. Drag handle is bigger (16px instead of 14px)
3. Drag handle has stronger visual presence:
   - Thicker border (2px)
   - Stronger shadow
   - Hover effect (blue border + blue background)
   - Better positioning (slightly further left)

4. Entire header bar is now draggable:
   - Can grab slide number/type header to drag
   - Header shows "grab" cursor
   - Header highlights on hover (subtle blue tint)
   - Tooltip says "Drag to reorder"

5. Thumbnail remains clickable for selection:
   - Click thumbnail → selects slide
   - Click/drag header → reorders slide
   - Clear separation of concerns

BEFORE:
- Tiny handle only visible on hover
- Easy to miss
- Users didn't know slides were draggable

AFTER:
- Always-visible drag handle on left
- Entire header bar is draggable
- Visual feedback on hover
- Much more discoverable
- Easier to grab and drag

This makes the drag & drop feature immediately obvious to users!
