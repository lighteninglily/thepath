FIX: Layout styles now persist correctly when reopening song editor

PROBLEM:
- User sets layout style to "Full Photo"
- Saves changes
- Reopens editor
- Layout randomly changes to "Split: Dark/Light" or other layout
- Very frustrating!

ROOT CAUSE:
- useEffect auto-initializes backgrounds/layouts when slideBackgrounds.length === 0
- When loading existing song, there's a brief moment where slideBackgrounds is []
- useEffect sees length === 0 and runs assignRandomLayouts()
- This OVERWRITES the layouts we just loaded from the database

SOLUTION:
- Check if song has existing slidesData with layouts before auto-initializing
- Skip auto-initialization if we're loading an existing song
- Only auto-initialize for NEW songs with no saved data

CODE CHANGES:
```
const hasExistingSlidesWithLayout = song?.slidesData && song.slidesData.some(s => s.layout);
if (currentSlides.length > 0 && !hasExistingSlidesWithLayout && ...) {
  // Only auto-initialize for new songs
}
```

IMPACT:
- Layouts now persist correctly across editor sessions
- No more random layout changes
- User's layout choices are respected and saved
- Background persistence also improved

TESTED:
- Save song with "Full Photo" layout
- Close editor
- Reopen editor
- Layout should still be "Full Photo" âœ“
