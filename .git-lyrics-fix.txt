FIX: Populate lyrics field from existing slides when editing songs

Extracts lyrics from slide content when lyrics field is empty

PROBLEM:
- When editing an existing song, lyrics textarea was empty
- Even though the lyrics existed in the slides
- This was confusing for users

SOLUTION:
- When loading a song for editing, check if lyrics field is empty
- If empty but slides exist, extract lyrics from slide content
- Reconstruct full lyrics by joining all slide text with line breaks
- Display in the lyrics textarea

NOW:
- Edit Song modal shows actual song lyrics
- Extracted from slide.content or slide.visualData.elements
- Prevents confusing empty lyrics field
- User can see and edit the full song text

This ensures existing song data is properly displayed when editing!
