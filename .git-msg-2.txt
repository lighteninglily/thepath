Quick fixes: Present button and scripture slide count selector

Present Button Fix:
- Fixed standalone Present button on service cards
- Now opens both audience window AND service editor modal
- Added delay to ensure state syncs properly
- Audience window reloads after 500ms to pick up presentation state

Scripture Slide Count Selector:
- Added ChevronUp/ChevronDown controls to adjust slide count
- AI recommends initial split (e.g. 8 slides)
- User can adjust from 1 to AI-recommended max
- Real-time preview updates
- splitIntoNParts() helper divides text evenly

Both issues resolved, ready for Phase 1 implementation
