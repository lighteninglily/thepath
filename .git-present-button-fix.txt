BUGFIX: Fix Present button on PlannerPage + Scripture insertion style

PRESENT BUTTON FIX:
Previously, clicking Present on main PlannerPage showed "Waiting for presentation..." and got stuck.

Solution:
- Present button now opens service in ServiceEditorModal
- Auto-starts presentation after modal opens
- Uses working presentation system from ServiceEditorModal
- Added autoStartPresentation props to coordinate

Flow now:
1. User clicks Present on PlannerPage
2. Service opens in editor modal
3. Presentation auto-starts (300ms delay for loading)
4. Presenter view shows with working controls
5. Audience window opens via Electron

SCRIPTURE INSERTION FIX:
- Added missing style property to scripture text elements
- Prevents "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'fontFamily')" error
- Scripture reference and text now render correctly in VisualCanvas

Both features now working correctly!
