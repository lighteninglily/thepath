CRITICAL FIX: Customize button now works - Opens Visual Editor

PROBLEM:
- User clicks "Customize" button in sermon builder
- Nothing happens
- Cannot edit slides in Visual Editor

ROOT CAUSE:
- SermonSlideBuilder had onOpenVisualEditor handler
- BUT AddSermonModal wasn't passing the prop
- No state management for Visual Editor integration

SOLUTION:
1. Added state management in AddSermonModal:
   - step: 'details' | 'builder' | 'visual-editor'
   - sermonSlides: tracks all slides
   - editingSlideIndex: which slide is being customized

2. Added handleOpenVisualEditor function:
   - Saves current slide state
   - Switches to visual-editor step
   - Opens SlideDesigner component

3. Added handleSaveFromVisualEditor function:
   - Gets changes from Visual Editor
   - Updates sermon slide visualData
   - Returns to builder

4. Pass onOpenVisualEditor prop to SermonSlideBuilder

WORKFLOW NOW:
1. Type content in sermon builder
2. Apply template (AI Suggest or manual)
3. Click "Customize"
4. Opens full Visual Editor with slide
5. Edit fonts, colors, positions, elements
6. Save
7. Back to sermon builder with changes

IMPACT:
- Customize button now fully functional ✓
- Round-trip editing works ✓
- Changes persist correctly ✓
- Professional customization available ✓
