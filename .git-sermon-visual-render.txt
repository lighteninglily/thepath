CRITICAL FIX: Sermon templates now render beautifully with VisualCanvas

PROBLEM:
- Sermon slide previews showed black background with plain text
- Templates weren't actually rendering their designs
- Looked unfinished and unprofessional

SOLUTION:
- Replaced simplified preview with actual VisualCanvas component
- Now shows real template designs with:
  * Beautiful gradient backgrounds
  * Properly positioned text elements
  * Correct fonts (Outfit, Inter, Georgia)
  * Proper font sizes (72px titles, 48px body, etc.)
  * Professional layouts

IMPACT:
- Sermon slides now look BEAUTIFUL immediately
- Templates apply visual formatting correctly
- Gradients, colors, typography all render properly
- Much more professional out-of-the-box

FILES CHANGED:
- SermonSlideEditor.tsx: Use VisualCanvas instead of simplified div

NEXT:
- Wire up Customize button to Visual Editor
- Add quick edit toolbar
- More templates
