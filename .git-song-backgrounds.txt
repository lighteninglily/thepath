Fix song slide backgrounds for audience view

Problem: Song slides showed backgrounds in presenter but not audience view

Root cause: Song slides were setting imageId but not imageUrl
AudienceViewPage needs the actual URL to load the image

Solution:
- Added imageUrl field to all song lyric slides (background.url)
- Added imageUrl field to title slide (background.url)  
- Added overlay settings for better text readability (50% opacity)

Now both title and lyric slides have:
- imageId (for reference)
- imageUrl (actual Unsplash URL for rendering)
- overlay (50% black for text readability)

Note: Existing songs in database need to be regenerated
New songs created after this fix will work correctly
