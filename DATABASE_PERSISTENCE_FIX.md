# 🎯 DATABASE PERSISTENCE - QUICK FIX!

## ✅ PROBLEM SOLVED!

**Issue**: Data resets on refresh  
**Cause**: Running web-only mode instead of Electron desktop app  
**Solution**: Run the Electron app properly!

---

## 🚀 THE FIX (Choose One):

### **Option 1: Run Desktop App (RECOMMENDED - Everything Already Works!)**

**Stop current dev server**, then run:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Vite dev server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start Electron app
npm run dev:electron
```

**OR use the combined command:**

```bash
# Build Electron once
npm run build:electron

# Then run Electron (it will use Vite dev server)
electron .
```

**What You Get:**
- ✅ Desktop application window
- ✅ SQLite database (data persists!)
- ✅ All features working
- ✅ No code changes needed!

---

### **Option 2: Keep Web Mode (Requires Backend)**

If you prefer browser development, we'd need to add:
- Express/Fastify backend server
- REST API endpoints  
- More complex setup

**NOT recommended** - Electron is easier and already working!

---

## 🔧 HOW IT WORKS:

### **Currently (Web Mode - NO Persistence):**
```
Browser → React App → Mock Data (in-memory) → ❌ Lost on refresh
```

### **With Electron (HAS Persistence):**
```
Electron → React App → window.electron → IPC → Database → ✅ Saved to disk!
```

---

## 📝 DETAILED STEPS:

### **1. Build Electron Components:**
```bash
npm run build:electron
```
This compiles:
- `electron/main.ts` → `dist-electron/main.js`
- `electron/preload.ts` → `dist-electron/preload.js`
- All database services

### **2. Start Development:**

**Option A - Two Terminals:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Vite dev server (React app)
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Electron (loads React from Vite)
electron .
```

**Option B - Combined (after initial build):**
```bash
npm run dev:electron
```

### **3. Verify It's Working:**
- Desktop window opens (not browser tab)
- Check console (F12): Should see "✅ Using real Electron API"
- Add a song
- Close app
- Reopen app
- Song is still there! ✅

---

## 🎯 WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE:

✅ **Electron main process** (`electron/main.ts`)  
✅ **SQLite database** (`electron/database/db.ts`)  
✅ **Database services** (SongService, TemplateService)  
✅ **IPC handlers** (db:getSongs, db:createSong, etc.)  
✅ **Preload script** (exposes window.electron)  
✅ **React hooks** (auto-detect Electron)  
✅ **Mock fallback** (for web development)  

**We literally just need to RUN it as Electron!**

---

## 🔄 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW:

### **Daily Development:**
```bash
# Start once:
npm run dev          # Terminal 1 (leave running)
npm run dev:electron # Terminal 2 (leave running)

# Make changes to React code → Vite hot reloads ✅
# Make changes to Electron code → Rebuild: npm run build:electron
```

### **Testing:**
- Electron window = real database
- Browser window = mock data (for quick UI testing)

## 📊 COMPARISON:

| Feature | Web Mode (npm run dev) | Electron Mode (dev:electron) |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Data persistence | ❌ Lost on refresh | ✅ Saved to SQLite |
| Desktop app | ❌ Browser only | ✅ Native window |
| Presentation mode | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Full-screen |
| File access | ❌ Sandboxed | ✅ Full access |
| Speed | ⚡ Fast (no IPC) | ⚡ Fast enough |
| Setup | ✅ Simple | ✅ Already done! |

---

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING:

### **"Cannot find module 'dist-electron/main.js'"**
```bash
npm run build:electron
```

### **"window.electron is undefined"**
- Make sure you ran `npm run dev:electron`, not just `npm run dev`
- Check preload script compiled: `dist-electron/preload.js` should exist

### **"Database file not found"**
- Database auto-creates on first run
- Location: `userData/songs.db` (OS-specific)
- Windows: `C:\Users\[You]\AppData\Roaming\the-path\`

### **Changes not saving**
- Verify you're in Electron (desktop window, not browser)
- Check console: Should say "✅ Using real Electron API"
- If it says "🔧 Using MOCK", you're in web mode

---

## ✅ RECOMMENDED APPROACH:

**For You: Just Run Electron!**

1. Keep two terminals open:
   - Terminal 1: `npm run dev` (Vite)
   - Terminal 2: `electron .` (after building once)

2. Develop in the Electron window (not browser)

3. Everything persists automatically!

**Why This is Best:**
- ✅ Already 100% set up
- ✅ Zero code changes needed
- ✅ Full features working
- ✅ Native desktop experience
- ✅ Data persistence for free

---

## 🎉 THAT'S IT!

You don't need to:
- ❌ Rebuild as web app
- ❌ Add backend server
- ❌ Change any code
- ❌ Set up new database

You just need to:
- ✅ Run `npm run dev:electron` instead of `npm run dev`
- ✅ Enjoy persistent data!

**The desktop app was the plan all along - let's use it!** 🚀
