# Getting Started with The Path

## ✅ What's Working Right Now

### React Development Server
The app is **running successfully** at http://localhost:5173!

You should see:
- **"The Path"** heading in a nice display font
- **"Church Presentation Software"** subtitle  
- **"Foundation is being built..."** message
- Beautiful earthy pastel color scheme

### Project Status
- ✅ Complete project structure
- ✅ All React/TypeScript/Vite dependencies installed
- ✅ Tailwind CSS configured with brand colors
- ✅ Development server working
- ⏳ SQLite database (waiting for build tools)
- ⏳ Electron desktop app (waiting for build tools)

---

## 🔧 To Complete Setup

### Install Visual Studio Build Tools

The **only** missing piece is `better-sqlite3`, which needs native compilation.

**Option 1: Automated (Easiest)**
```powershell
# Run as Administrator
npm install --global windows-build-tools
```

**Option 2: Manual**
1. Download: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
2. Install "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022"
3. Select workload: "Desktop development with C++"
4. Wait for installation (can take 20-30 minutes)

**Option 3: Skip for Now**
- You can continue building UI components without the database
- We'll add database functionality later

---

## 🚀 After Installing Build Tools

1. **Add better-sqlite3 back**:
   ```powershell
   npm install better-sqlite3 @types/better-sqlite3 --save
   ```

2. **Uncomment database code**:
   - `electron/main.ts` (line 3, 10)
   - `electron/database/db.ts` (entire function)

3. **Build Electron app**:
   ```powershell
   npm run build:electron
   npm run dev:electron
   ```
