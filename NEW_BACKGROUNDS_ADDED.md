## 🎨 USING FOREST BACKGROUNDS

### **Option 1: Add to AI Theme Selection**

If you want AI to automatically use forest backgrounds, I can:
1. Add forest as a 4th theme option (alongside mountains, clouds, waves)
2. Map it to specific song moods (e.g., earthy, natural, peaceful)
3. AI will then select forest for appropriate songs

**Just let me know if you want this!**

### **Option 2: Manual Selection Only** (Current)

Forest backgrounds are available when:
- Manually creating/editing songs
- Choosing theme packs from dropdown
- But AI won't auto-select them

---

## 🧪 TEST YOUR NEW BACKGROUNDS

### **Test Waves:**
1. Generate a new song with AI
2. If it picks "Waves" theme
3. You'll see your new wave images rotating through!

### **Test Forest:**
1. Create or edit a song manually
2. Select "Forest" or "Nature" theme pack
3. Your new forest images will be available!
