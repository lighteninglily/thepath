## ⏭️ PHASE 1.5 (Pending)

### Scripture Lookup in Visual Editor
**Status**: Not implemented (complexity)  
**Reason**: VisualItemEditorModal file structure complex  
**Alternative**: Users can still add scripture via main service builder  
**Priority**: Medium (nice-to-have, not critical)

**Would require**:
- Add "Insert Scripture" button to Visual Editor toolbar
- Import AddScriptureModal
- Add handler to insert scripture as text elements
- Handle positioning and formatting

**Estimated time**: 30 minutes  
**Recommendation**: Defer to Phase 3 (UI/UX Polish)
