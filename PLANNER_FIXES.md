## ðŸ’¡ TECHNICAL NOTES

### **Type Handling**
The Service type exists in two places:
- `types/index.ts` - Has `date: string | null`
- `types/service.ts` - Has `date: string`

Used `selectedServiceId: string | null` instead of `selectedService` to avoid type conflicts temporarily.

### **Mock vs Real Database**
The hooks check for Electron environment:
- **In Electron**: Uses IPC to real SQLite database
- **In Browser**: Uses mock API with localStorage
- Both work identically for development

### **React Query**
All hooks use React Query for:
- Automatic refetching
- Cache invalidation
- Loading states
- Error handling

- âœ… Modal creates service successfully
- âœ… Service appears in list immediately
- âœ… "Edit" button responds to click
- âœ… No errors in console
