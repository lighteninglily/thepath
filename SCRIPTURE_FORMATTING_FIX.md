# 📖 SCRIPTURE FORMATTING FIX

**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ AI Prompt Updated

---

## 🐛 **PROBLEMS FOUND**

### **Problem 1: Template ID Mismatch**
```
❌ Template not found: scripture-classic
```

**Cause**: AI prompt referenced `scripture-classic` but actual template ID is `scripture-classic-center`

**Fix**: Updated AI prompt template IDs to match actual templates:
- `scripture-classic` → `scripture-classic-center`
- `scripture-modern` → `scripture-modern-split`

---

### **Problem 2: Scripture Not Being Parsed**

**Logs showed**:
```
✅ Final content for verse-text: Scripture John 3:16 - For God so loved the world
✅ Final content for reference: [EMPTY]
```

**Problem**: The ENTIRE input was being placed in the verse text, and the reference field was empty!

**Expected**:
- `verse-text`: "For God so loved the world"
- `reference`: "John 3:16"

**Actual**:
- `verse-text`: "Scripture John 3:16 - For God so loved the world"
- `reference`: ""

**Cause**: AI wasn't extracting `scriptureReference` and `scriptureText` as separate fields.

---

## ✅ **THE FIXES**

### **Fix 1: Correct Template IDs**

**electron/main.ts - Lines 465-466**:

**Before**:
```typescript
- scripture-classic: Bible reference + verse text in traditional layout
- scripture-modern: Contemporary scripture design with reference
```

**After**:
```typescript
- scripture-classic-center: Bible reference + verse text in traditional layout
- scripture-modern-split: Contemporary scripture design with split layout
```

---

### **Fix 2: Explicit Scripture Parsing Instructions**

**electron/main.ts - Lines 488-492**:

**Before**:
```
1. Scripture references (John 3:16, etc.) → scripture-classic or scripture-modern
```

**After**:
```
1. Scripture references (John 3:16, etc.) → scripture-classic-center or scripture-modern-split
   - IMPORTANT: Extract the reference (e.g. "John 3:16") separately from the verse text
   - Example: "Scripture John 3:16 - For God so loved the world"
     → scriptureReference: "John 3:16"
     → scriptureText: "For God so loved the world"
```

---

### **Fix 3: Clarify Placeholder Extraction**

**electron/main.ts - Lines 506-507**:

**Before**:
```
- scriptureReference: Bible verse reference
- scriptureText: The actual verse
```

**After**:
```
- scriptureReference: Bible verse reference ONLY (e.g., "John 3:16", "Psalm 23:1-3")
- scriptureText: The actual verse text WITHOUT the reference (e.g., "For God so loved the world")
```

---

### **Fix 4: Add Scripture Examples**

**electron/main.ts - Lines 521-532**:

**Added**:
```
Scripture parsing example:
Content: "Scripture John 3:16 - For God so loved the world"
→ Extract: { 
  "scriptureReference": "John 3:16",
  "scriptureText": "For God so loved the world"
}

Content: "John 3:16\nFor God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son"
→ Extract: {
  "scriptureReference": "John 3:16",
  "scriptureText": "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son"
}
```

## 🧪 **HOW TO TEST**

### **Test 1: Simple Scripture**
1. **Restart the app** (to reload AI prompt)
2. Create new slide
3. Type: **"Scripture John 3:16 - For God so loved the world"**
4. Wait for AI to format

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Template: `scripture-classic-center` or `scripture-modern-split`
- ✅ Left side: "TODAY'S SCRIPTURE"
- ✅ Right side (verse): "For God so loved the world"
- ✅ Right side (reference): "JOHN 3:16"

---

### **Test 2: Multi-line Scripture**
1. Type:
   ```
   John 3:16
   For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son
   ```
2. Wait for AI

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Reference extracted: "John 3:16"
- ✅ Text extracted: "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son"
- ✅ Properly formatted in split layout

---

### **Test 3: Long Verse**
1. Type:
   ```
   Romans 8:38-39
   For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
   ```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Reference: "Romans 8:38-39"
- ✅ Full verse text displayed cleanly

---

## 📊 **BEFORE vs AFTER**

### **Before Fix**:

**Input**: "Scripture John 3:16 - For God so loved the world"

**AI Output**:
```json
{
  "templateId": "scripture-classic",  ❌ Wrong template ID
  "placeholders": {
    "scriptureText": "Scripture John 3:16 - For God so loved the world",  ❌ Everything in one field
    "scriptureReference": ""  ❌ Empty!
  }
}
```

**Result**: 
- ❌ Template not found error
- ❌ Entire input in verse text
- ❌ No reference shown

---

### **After Fix**:

**Input**: "Scripture John 3:16 - For God so loved the world"

**AI Output** (Expected):
```json
{
  "templateId": "scripture-classic-center",  ✅ Correct!
  "placeholders": {
    "scriptureReference": "John 3:16",  ✅ Separated!
    "scriptureText": "For God so loved the world"  ✅ Clean text!
  }
}
```

**Result**: 
- ✅ Template found and applied
- ✅ Reference in correct position
- ✅ Verse text clean and readable

---

## 💡 **WHY THIS HAPPENED**

### **Root Causes**:

1. **Template ID Mismatch**: 
   - Templates were created with full descriptive IDs (`scripture-classic-center`)
   - AI prompt referenced short IDs (`scripture-classic`)
   - No validation between prompt and actual templates

2. **Vague Instructions**:
   - AI prompt said "extract reference and text"
   - But didn't show HOW to separate them
   - No examples of proper parsing

3. **No Format Examples**:
   - AI had to guess the input format
   - Different users type scripture differently
   - Needed clear examples for common patterns

---

## 🎯 **LESSONS LEARNED**

### **For AI Prompts**:
1. ✅ Always use exact template IDs from code
2. ✅ Provide explicit parsing examples
3. ✅ Show multiple input variations
4. ✅ Be specific about field separation
5. ✅ Include edge cases (multi-line, long verses, etc.)

### **For Template System**:
1. ✅ Keep template IDs simple OR document them clearly
2. ✅ Validate template IDs at runtime
3. ✅ Log when templates are not found
4. ✅ Provide fallback templates

---

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Restart the app** to load new AI prompt
2. **Test scripture slides** with various formats
3. **Verify** reference and text are properly separated
4. **Check** that both scripture templates work
5. **Report** any remaining issues

---

## 📝 **FILES CHANGED**

### **electron/main.ts**
- Lines 465-466: Fixed template IDs
- Lines 488-492: Added explicit scripture parsing rules
- Lines 506-507: Clarified placeholder definitions
- Lines 521-532: Added scripture parsing examples

**Total Changes**: 4 sections, ~20 lines modified/added

---

## ✅ **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

After restart, verify:
- [ ] Scripture template found (no "Template not found" error)
- [ ] Reference field populated correctly
- [ ] Verse text field clean (no reference included)
- [ ] Split layout working (dark left, light right)
- [ ] Text readable and properly sized
- [ ] Multiple scripture formats handled correctly

---

**🎉 Scripture formatting should now work perfectly with AI extraction!**

**Remember to RESTART the app for the AI prompt changes to take effect!** 🔄
