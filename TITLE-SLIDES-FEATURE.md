# ‚úÖ Automatic Title Slides Feature - COMPLETE

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

---

## üéØ FEATURE OVERVIEW

Every song now automatically gets a **title slide** as the first slide, displaying:
- **Song Title** (large, bold)
- **Artist Name** (below title)

### **Why This Matters:**
During worship services, when transitioning between songs, the congregation and operators now see a clear title slide indicating the song has changed. No more confusion about which song is being displayed!

## üé® TITLE SLIDE DESIGN

  fontSize: 88px,
  fontWeight: 800 (extra bold),
  textAlign: 'center',
  position: { x: 160, y: 380 },  // Vertically centered
  size: { width: 1600, height: 320 },
  textShadow: '4px 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.95)',
  background: First image from theme pack
}
```

```

### **New System:**
```

- Example: `"Amazing Grace"` (without artist line)

### **Empty Title:**
- No title slide created
- Falls back to original behavior
- Songs still work normally

### **Existing Songs (Legacy):**
- Songs created before this feature don't have title slides
- **Solution**: Re-save song to add title slide, or manually add one
