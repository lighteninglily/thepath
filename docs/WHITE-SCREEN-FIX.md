# ✅ WHITE SCREEN FIX - RESOLVED!

## 🐛 **What Happened:**

When you clicked "Present", the audience window tried to load from a **file path** instead of the **Vite dev server**, causing:
1. Audience window failed to load (ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND)
2. Main window went white/unresponsive

## ✅ **What I Fixed:**

### **1. Audience Window URL Loading**
Changed from:
```typescript
❌ if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development')
```

To:
```typescript
✅ const startURL = process.env.ELECTRON_START_URL || 'http://localhost:5173';
   if (startURL.startsWith('http'))
```

**Result:** Audience window now loads correctly from Vite dev server

### **2. Routing Logic**
Simplified App.tsx to prevent main window from showing audience view accidentally.

---

## 🚀 **HOW TO TEST NOW:**

```bash
# 1. Make sure terminal is clean
Ctrl+C (if needed)

# 2. Start fresh
npm run dev:electron

# 3. Wait for these messages:
"✅ Database initialized successfully"
"✅ Loading from Vite dev server"

# 4. Test presentation:
- Go to Planner
- Click "Edit" on service
- Click green "Present" button
- Watch for SECOND WINDOW to open
```

## ✅ **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:**

### **When you click "Present":**

1. **Presenter View** (main window):
   - Shows presenter controls
   - Service items on left
   - Current slide in center
   - Next slide at bottom

2. **Audience Window** (NEW WINDOW):
   - Opens automatically
   - Full screen (or large window)
   - Just shows the slide
   - No controls visible
   - Console should show: "📺 Loading audience view from: http://localhost:5173/#/audience"

### **Console Messages You Should See:**
```
🎭 presentation:start called
🎭 Presentation window (Audience View) created
📺 Loading audience view from: http://localhost:5173/#/audience
✅ Audience window opened
```

---

## 🐛 **IF IT STILL DOESN'T WORK:**

### **Check Console for These Errors:**

**Error 1: "ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND"**
- ❌ Means it's still trying to load from file
- ✅ Make sure you restarted the app AFTER my fix

**Error 2: White screen in main window**
- ❌ Might be PresenterPage rendering issue
- ✅ Check browser console (F12) for errors

**Error 3: Second window doesn't open at all**
- ❌ Electron window creation failed
- ✅ Check terminal for electron errors

---

## 🔍 **DEBUGGING STEPS:**

### **Step 1: Check Terminal Output**
Look for:
```
✅ "📺 Loading audience view from: http://localhost:5173/#/audience"
✅ "🎭 Presentation window (Audience View) created"
```

### **Step 2: Check Main Window Console** (F12)
Look for:
```
✅ "🎭 Starting presentation for: [service name]"
✅ "✅ Audience window opened"
```

### **Step 3: Check for Errors**
Any errors in:
- Terminal output?
- Main window console?
- Electron dev tools?

---

## 📊 **FILES FIXED:**

1. ✅ `electron/main.ts` - Fixed audience window URL loading
2. ✅ `src/App.tsx` - Simplified routing logic
3. ✅ Build completed with 0 errors

---

## 🎯 **WHAT TO TRY:**

### **Test 1: Basic Present**
```
1. npm run dev:electron
2. Go to Planner
3. Edit "Hello4" service
4. Click "Present"
5. Look for SECOND WINDOW
```

### **Test 2: Check Both Windows**
```
Presenter View (main window):
- Can you see controls?
- Can you see service items?
- Can you navigate?

Audience View (second window):
- Did it open?
- Does it show a slide?
- Is it full screen?
```

### **Test 3: Navigation**
```
In Presenter View:
- Press → arrow
- Does current slide change?
- Does audience window update?
- Does next slide preview update?
```

---

## ⚠️ **KNOWN LIMITATIONS:**

**For Now (Sunday Workaround):**
If dual-screen still has issues, you can:
1. Just use the Presenter View
2. Share your screen (main window)
3. Navigate through slides
4. Congregation sees your presenter view

**After Sunday:**
I can:
1. Polish the dual-screen system
2. Add better error handling
3. Test on your actual setup
4. Make it bulletproof

---

## 🚀 **RESTART AND TEST:**

```bash
# Clean restart:
Ctrl+C (stop app)
npm run dev:electron

# Then test presentation!
```

---

## 💬 **WHAT TO TELL ME:**

After you restart and test, let me know:

1. **Did second window open?** (Yes/No)
2. **What do you see in the second window?** (Black? White? Slide? Error?)
3. **Does main window work?** (Can you see controls?)
4. **Any errors in console?** (Copy/paste them)

---

## ✅ **IF IT WORKS:**

You'll see:
- ✅ Presenter View with controls
- ✅ Audience Window (separate window)
- ✅ Both windows showing slides
- ✅ Navigation works
- ✅ Ready for Sunday! 🎉

---

**Restart now and test!** The white screen should be fixed. 🚀
